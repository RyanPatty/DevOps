## What Is DevOps? — Tailored for the DevOps Engineer Role at **Brite Systems**

> **Context**: Brite Systems needs a DevOps Engineer who can design GitHub‑centric CI/CD pipelines, automate AWS infrastructure with Terraform/CloudFormation, and secure deployments with **AWS Secrets Manager**. The explanation below keeps Nana’s original narrative but swaps in the exact tools and responsibilities called out in the job description.

---

### Why DevOps Matters at Brite Systems
DevOps removes bottlenecks in delivering software to Brite’s public‑ and private‑sector clients. Here you’ll learn:
- Why DevOps is essential for secure, repeatable releases
- How DevOps aligns with Brite’s stack (GitHub Actions + AWS)
- What a DevOps Engineer does day‑to‑day in this environment
- How SRE principles complement DevOps for reliability

### Defining DevOps (Brite Edition)
At its core, DevOps is the **intersection of development and operations**, powered here by:
- **GitHub** for code and workflow automation
- **AWS** for scalable, cloud‑native infrastructure
- **Terraform / CloudFormation** for Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- **AWS Secrets Manager** for credential management

### End‑to‑End Release Flow (Brite Toolchain)
1. **Plan & Code** → Developers commit code to **GitHub**.
2. **Build & Test** → **GitHub Actions** runs unit/integration tests, builds Docker images, and scans for vulnerabilities.
3. **Package & Store** → Images are pushed to **Amazon ECR**; artifacts land in **S3**.
4. **Deploy** → GitHub Actions triggers Terraform/CloudFormation to provision or update resources (EC2, Lambda, RDS, EKS). Secrets are injected from **AWS Secrets Manager**.
5. **Operate & Monitor** → Workloads run on EKS/EC2; telemetry flows to **CloudWatch** and Prometheus/Grafana dashboards; alerts feed Slack/Teams.
6. **Iterate** → Feedback loops drive new pull requests—continuous delivery in action.

### Key Challenges & DevOps Solutions (Mapped to Brite)
| Challenge | DevOps Remedy with Brite Tools |
|-----------|--------------------------------|
| Miscommunication between Dev & Ops | Single‑source workflows in **GitHub**, IaC reviews in PRs, shared CloudWatch dashboards |
| Speed vs. Stability | **GitHub Actions** gates (tests, security scans) + SRE error budgets on EKS |
| Manual Deployments | Declarative **Terraform / CloudFormation** modules and GitHub Actions runners |
| Secret Handling | Centralize creds in **AWS Secrets Manager** with least‑privilege IAM |

### The Brite‑Approved DevOps Toolchain
| Category | Job‑Aligned Tool(s) |
|----------|---------------------|
| **Version Control** | Git + GitHub |
| **CI/CD** | **GitHub Actions** (with OIDC to AWS)
| **Containerization** | Docker (images stored in Amazon ECR) |
| **Orchestration** | Kubernetes on **EKS** |
| **IaC** | **Terraform** modules or **AWS CloudFormation** stacks |
| **Secrets** | **AWS Secrets Manager** |
| **Compute / Storage** | EC2, Lambda, S3, RDS |
| **Monitoring** | CloudWatch, Prometheus, Grafana |
| **Scripting** | Python, Bash, PowerShell |

### Day‑to‑Day Responsibilities
- **Pipeline Engineering:** Write & maintain GitHub Actions workflows for build, test, security scan, and deploy.
- **Secrets Management:** Store and rotate credentials in AWS Secrets Manager; integrate via GitHub Actions OIDC.
- **IaC Automation:** Author Terraform modules or CloudFormation templates for repeatable infrastructure.
- **Cloud Operations:** Spin up and tune AWS services (EC2, Lambda, S3, RDS, EKS) with cost and security in mind.
- **Monitoring & Incident Response:** Wire metrics/logs (CloudWatch + Prometheus) and refine alerts; embrace SRE practices to uphold SLIs/SLOs.
- **Security Best Practices:** Enforce IAM least‑privilege, enable pipeline secrets‑scanning, patch container images.

### DevOps vs. SRE at Brite
- **DevOps:** Automates delivery and infrastructure to accelerate change.
- **SRE:** Ensures those changes keep the system reliable (latency, uptime, error rates).
- Together they enable fast, stable releases to Brite’s clients.

### Getting Started in This Role
1. **Master GitHub Actions:** Composite actions, reusable workflows, OIDC federation to AWS.
2. **Deep‑Dive Terraform/CloudFormation:** Write DRY modules/stacks; use `terraform fmt`, `cloudformation validate` in CI.
3. **Learn Secrets Manager Patterns:** Parameterize apps with secret ARNs; automate rotation.
4. **Container Basics:** Build minimal‑base Docker images; deploy to **EKS** with Helm or Argo CD.
5. **Automate Everything:** Every manual step goes into code—pipelines, IaC, or scripts.

### Final Thoughts
At Brite Systems, DevOps isn’t just theory—it’s a hands‑on discipline that marries **GitHub Actions**, **AWS**, and **IaC** for secure, repeatable, and auditable delivery. Bring curiosity, scripting chops, and a security‑first mindset, and you’ll thrive.
