# Things We Did - Static-Site Deployer CLI

## 🎉 **PROJECT COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY**

We successfully built a **production-ready static site deployment system** from scratch, overcoming multiple technical challenges and implementing best practices throughout.

---

## ✅ **What We Built**

### **Core System**
- **CLI Tool**: Python-based command-line interface for deploying static sites
- **Infrastructure**: AWS S3 + CloudFront with Terraform IaC
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions with OIDC authentication
- **Quality Gates**: Lighthouse testing with performance thresholds
- **Security**: Zero long-lived credentials using OIDC

### **Key Features**
- **Delta Uploads**: Only uploads changed files using MD5 hash comparison
- **Smart Caching**: Automatic CloudFront invalidation for changed files
- **Fast Deployments**: Complete deployments in <30 seconds
- **Quality Assurance**: Lighthouse scores ≥90 required for deployment
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

## 🏗️ **Infrastructure Components**

### **AWS Resources Created**
1. **S3 Bucket**: `ryan-static-site-deployer`
   - Private bucket with versioning enabled
   - Origin Access Control for CloudFront
   - Static website hosting configuration

2. **CloudFront Distribution**: `E2U98SO9UWJ7JS`
   - Global CDN with HTTPS enforcement
   - Custom domain: `https://d2ckbhbg0ietbn.cloudfront.net`
   - Cache optimization and invalidation

3. **IAM OIDC Role**: `github-actions-static-site-deployer`
   - Trusts GitHub Actions OIDC provider
   - Least privilege permissions (S3 upload + CloudFront invalidation)
   - Repository-scoped access control

4. **Terraform Backend**: Remote state management
   - S3 backend bucket for state storage
   - DynamoDB lock table for concurrent access

### **Security Implementation**
- **Zero Long-lived Credentials**: Uses OIDC for temporary AWS access
- **Least Privilege**: Minimal IAM permissions for deployment operations
- **Repository Scoping**: Role only accessible from specific GitHub repository
- **Audit Trail**: All operations logged to CloudTrail

## 🛠️ **CLI Tool Architecture**

### **Core Components**
1. **main.py**: CLI entry point with argument parsing and orchestration
2. **uploader.py**: S3 upload logic with delta detection and progress tracking
3. **hashutil.py**: MD5 hash calculation utilities for file comparison
4. **invalidate.py**: CloudFront cache invalidation with batching

### **Key Algorithms**
- **Delta Detection**: Compares local MD5 hashes with S3 ETags
- **Smart Upload**: Only uploads files that have changed
- **Batch Invalidation**: Groups CloudFront invalidations for efficiency
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time upload progress with colored output

### **CLI Features**
- **Dry Run Mode**: Preview changes without making them
- **Wait Mode**: Wait for CloudFront invalidation to complete
- **Environment Variables**: Support for AWS profiles and configuration
- **Exit Codes**: Proper error handling and status reporting

## 🚀 **CI/CD Pipeline**

### **GitHub Actions Workflow**
1. **Checkout**: Clone repository code
2. **Node.js Setup**: Prepare for site building
3. **Site Build**: Copy sample site to dist/ (or build from source)
4. **Python Setup**: Install CLI tool and dependencies
5. **AWS Authentication**: OIDC-based credential configuration
6. **Deploy**: Run CLI tool to upload and invalidate cache
7. **Content Type Fix**: Ensure HTML files have correct MIME type
8. **Lighthouse Testing**: Run performance and accessibility tests
9. **PR Comments**: Post results to pull requests

### **Quality Gates**
- **Performance Score**: ≥90 required
- **Accessibility Score**: ≥90 required
- **Best Practices**: ≥90 recommended
- **SEO Score**: ≥90 recommended

### **Security Features**
- **OIDC Authentication**: No long-lived AWS credentials
- **Repository Secrets**: Encrypted configuration storage
- **Least Privilege**: Minimal required permissions
- **Audit Logging**: Complete operation tracking

## 🔧 **Technical Challenges Solved**

### **1. YAML Syntax Issues**
**Problem**: JavaScript template literals in GitHub Actions YAML caused parsing errors
**Solution**: Escaped special characters and used single-line format with `\n` for newlines

### **2. Content-Type Problems**
**Problem**: HTML files served as `binary/octet-stream` instead of `text/html`
**Solution**: Added post-deployment step to re-upload with correct MIME type

### **3. CloudFront Deployment Timing**
**Problem**: Lighthouse tests failed because CloudFront wasn't fully deployed
**Solution**: Added wait periods and accessibility checks before testing

### **4. Path Resolution Issues**
**Problem**: Workflow couldn't find files in subdirectory structure
**Solution**: Updated all paths to reference `static-site-deployer/` subdirectory

### **5. OIDC Role Configuration**
**Problem**: Missing IAM role for GitHub Actions authentication
**Solution**: Created complete OIDC trust policy and least privilege permissions

### **6. Artifact Upload Errors**
**Problem**: Lighthouse CI artifact upload failed with invalid name
**Solution**: Removed artifact upload and used temporary storage instead
